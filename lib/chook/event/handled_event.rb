  # classes are defined here, including the interaction with the Handlers
  # module.

  # Chook::Event::EVENTS
  #
  # Each subclass will have a constant SUBJECT_CLASS containing the
  # class of their #subject attribute.
  #
  class HandledEvent < Chook::Event

    #### Class Methods

    # For each event type in Chook::Event::EVENTS
    # generate a class for it, set its SUBJECT_CLASS constant
    # and add it to the HandledEvents module.

        # for finding it's handlers, among other things.

    #### Attributes

    # @return [Array<Proc,Pathname>] the handlers defined for this event.
    #   Each is either a proc, in which case it is called with this
    #   instance as its sole paramter, or its a Pathname to an executable
    #   file, in which case the @raw_json is passed to its stdin.
    #   See the Chook::HandledEvent::Handlers module.
