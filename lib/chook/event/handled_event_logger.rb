module Chook

  # a simple object embedded in a Handled Event that
  # allows a standardize way to note event-related log entries
  # with the event object_id.
  #
  # Every Handled Event has one of these instances exposed in it's
  # #logger attribute, and usable from within 'internal' handlers
  #
  # Here's an example.
  #
  # Say you have a ComputerSmartGroupMembershipChanged event
  #
  # calling `event.logger.info "foobar"` will generate the log message:
  #
  #    Event 1234567: foobar
  #
  class HandledEventLogger

    def initialize(event)
      @event = event
    end

    def event_message(msg)
      "Event #{@event.id}: #{msg}"
    end

    def debug(msg)
      Chook::Server::Log.logger.debug event_message(msg)
