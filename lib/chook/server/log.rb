# the main module
module Chook

  # the server app
  class Server < Sinatra::Base

    # the CustomLogger helper allows us to
    # use our own Logger instance as the
    # Sinatra `logger` available in routes vis `set :logger...`
    helpers Sinatra::CustomLogger

    # This module defines our custom Logger instance from the config settings
    # and makes it available in the .logger module method,
    # which is used anywhere outside of a route
    # (inside of a route, the #logger method is locally available)
    #
    # General access to the logger:
    #   from anywhere in Chook, as long as a server is running, the Logger
    #   instance is available at Chook.logger or Chook::Server::Log.logger
    #
    #
    # Logging from inside a route:
    #   inside a Sinatra route, the local `logger` method returnes the
    #   Logger instance.
    #
    # Logging from an internal handler:
    #  In an internal WebHook handler, starting with `Chook.event_handler do |event|`
    #  the logger should be accesses via the event's own wrapper: event.logger
    #  Each message will be prepended with the event'd ID
    #
    # Logging from an external handler:
    #  from an external handler you can POST a JSON formatted log entry to
    #  http(s)://chookserver/log. The body must be a JSON object with 2 keys:
    #  'level' and 'message', with non-empty strings.
    #  The level must be one of: fatal, error, warn, info, or debug. Any other
    #  value as the level will always be logged regardless of current logging
    #  level. NOTE: if your server requires authentication, you must provide it
    #  when using this route.
    #
    # Here's an example with curl, split to multi-line for clarity:
    #
    # curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    #   -X POST \
    #   --data '{"level":"debug", "message":"It Worked"}' \
    #   https://user:passwd@chookserver.myorg.org:443/log
