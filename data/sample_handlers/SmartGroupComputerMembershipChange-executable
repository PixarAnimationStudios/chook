# NOTE: Native bash doesn't have any easy way to parse JSON.
# Instead, you should really use a tool like 'jq' https://stedolan.github.io/jq/.
#
# If you have jq, set its correct path in the JQ variable below.
#
# It's beyond the scope of this example to parse the JSON with regular expressions
# which is a horrible idea anyway.

# Enter your path to jq
JQ=/usr/local/bin/jq
